# React/Typescript Chess

This is a basic **React** app written in **Typescript** with the goal to recreate the game of Chess.
The project was started with *Vite*, uses Typescript to enforce type safety principles, and **Redux** for state management.
The game logic and front-end were all coded by myself.
The main purpose of this project was to practice and apply some of the concepts that I have started learning about in JavaScript and web development.
The most important and fundamental aspects of the game, such a keeping and updating board and pieces state, identifying when a player is in check or checkmate, identifying possible and legal moves for each piece and executing them, are all working decently well.
The more advanced mechanics like casting, en-passant, and identifying a stalemate, have yet to be implemented.
